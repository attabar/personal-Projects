This is the PHP Devs coding Challenge, which we're submitting on 16/12/2023

This task were developed using HTML, CSS, Jquery, Ajax, Core PHP and PDO.

for the admin login page use this as 
username  =  AbdulmalikDev
password  =  AbdulmalikDev@306

if you submitted the form of login page, Ajax would send request asyncronously to server to check whether
the username and the password are equivalent to the one which we stored in the database, if the username
is not exist you would see error message pop up saying user is not found, if the username entered were exist
and the password found does not exist you'll see error message pop up saying incorrect password, if the username
and the password were both exists you'll see successful message pop up saying admin login successfully and after 
4 seconds of delay then it will redirect you to student bio data form where you'll submit a form of five input fields,
after successfully submitted it would redirect you to crud operation page where you can view all the previous form fields
submitted with create button, delete, update.

if you click on the add data(create) it would take you to student bio data form where you can add new data.

if you click on update it would take you to update form where you can able to edit the specific data selected.

if you click on delete it would delete the specific data selected.

for you to test this task just create a database name (challenge) in your mysql database then download the whole
of this task source code on your machine, in your mysql database import a file inside PHP folder with name database.sql
under the database you have created after that you're good to go for test the task.
